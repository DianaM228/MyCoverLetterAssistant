2. Experience
2.0 In 2023 I was Chief AI Scientis at Albatros-Intelligence. I conducted the state of the art on wildfire detection and monitoring. Subsequently, I proposed an scheme with multiple modules for wildfire detection and monitoring using deep learning and computer vision. I collected and processed the data to train and validate the models using Pytorch, OpenCV and Weights and Biases. Finally, I performed the deployment using Docker. I also conducted interviews to candidates to be part of the team.
2.1 From 2019 to 2022, during three years I developed my PhD thesis. Name of the project "Development of a spatio-temporal neural network for measuring remote photoplethysmography signals". Tasks: I investigated and replicated state-of-the-art Deep Learning models for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signal measurement. Using Pytorch, I proposed a new framework that 1) proved to match the heart rate measurement performance found in the literature and 2) increased the measurement speed for real-time use. In addition, I proposed an LSTM-based framework for filtering rPPG signals that outperformed conventional filtering methods.
2.2 During 2021 and 2022, I was a University teacher at ESIREM and IUT. Dijon-France. (82 hours). Name of the courses: Information Science and Processing, and Image Processing.
2.3 During the two years of 2018 and 2019 I was in a Research project called "Development and evaluation of a non-invasive portable system based on multispectral imaging for the diagnosis and follow-up of treatment of skin ulcers caused by Leishmaniasis". My work within the project consists of extracting the variations of the main chromophores of skin infected by Leishmaniasis, through a inverse model of optimization in a diffuse reflectance model.
2.4 During the two years of 2017 and 2019 I worked as a "Laboratory technician". My duties were: administering the teaching laboratory and advising undergraduate students.
2.5 In 2017 I worked in a Research project called "Implementation of a system of absolute micro-positioning of cell cultures in optical microscopy". My duties within the project consisted of developing a graphical interface (GUI) in C++ with OpenCV libraries, where the spectral analysis of a pseudo-periodic point image was made to define a micro-metric absolute position in a XY plane.
2.6 In 2016 I worked in a Research project called "Development of an MPPT algorithm with single voltage/current sensor for maximizing power in the load of photovoltaic systems". I worked on this project as a laboratory assistant. My duty was to make a virtual instrument (VI) in the LabView software, for the implementation of a follow-up algorithm of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of a solar panel.
2.7 In 2015 I worked in a Research project called "Implementation of software to quantify the main components of cardiovascular tissue from multi-spectral images". Some of my duties in this project was the realization of a graphic interface (GUI) in Matlab, responsible for making an analysis of multispectral images of cardiovascular tissue to quantify its main components.
